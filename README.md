## What happens to my chat data?

**No chat data is transferred to any remote server, all analysis is performed locally on your device**

The application works completly offline once the page has loaded. You can turn off your internet before loading your data file if you are particularly concerned. You can also take a look at the source code and give it an audit.

## Reporting Issues

Please open a [new Github Issue](https://github.com/mowolf/ChatAnalyzer/issues/new) if you find any issues or have suggestions/improvements for the project.

Please also supply your data format (e.g. `[07.09.17, 6:44:16 PM] NAME: message`) and Language/Region setting of our phone if you are having a specific problem with data not loading correctly.

## Have a great idea for a new graph?

Head over to [planned features](https://github.com/mowolf/ChatAnalyzer/labels/enhancement) and add your idea if it's missing!

## Wanna help making this better?

Cheers! You are very welcome! Just submit a pull request. The goal of this tool is to automize the parsing as much as possible.

### Add your language identifier for audio/video/pictures

Please see the header of `main.js`. There you can add your identifiers.

### Markov Chain

To generate text that sounds like you check here: https://github.com/mowolf/markov_chain_js/tree/master

### How the data is parsed & how you can build on that

The chat data is parsed via regex and splitted into it's parts. There are two variables that hold the data.

*`structArray`:*
Formatted line data in the form of a struct with the keys: name date time message

- `name`: "Name Surname"
- `date`: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- `time`: "HH:MM:SS"
- `message`: text

each key represents an array, the index represents the line number
e.g. structArray.date[0] is the date of the first line

*`userStruct`:*

Array of structs with the keys:

- `name`: "Name Surname"
- `date`: "YYYY-MM-DD"
- `time`: "HH:MM:SS"
- `message`: text

For every person there is one struct, same format as above, the `index` represents messageNumber of `name`.
